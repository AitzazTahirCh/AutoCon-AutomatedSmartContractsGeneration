# AutoCon-Automated SmartContracts Generation via GUI
AutoCon is a web application for building solidity smart contracts for ethereum blockchain in an efficient way for all technical and nontechnical people with very less knowledge of coding.

## AutoCon Process:

It shows the work process of AutoCon. AutoCon when accessed takes you to a landing page. It then allows you to access the IDE where at first the user has toconnect their cryptocurrency wallet. In the case of AutoCon, we have used MetaMask wallet. After connecting to the wallet, the user can create the smart contract using the components of AutoCon and finally deploy it on the blockchain.

We have got the button "Launch IDE" which takes us to the smart contracts creation page.

It shows the smart contracts creation page where we can see the solidity components on the left side. On the top right corner, we can see our wallet address connected to AutoCon. At the bottom there are two buttons Preview which shows the code youâ€™v written with the help of drag and drop of components and Deploy button that deploys your contract

It is how contract is created in AutoCon with the help of drag and drop components from the components menu on the left.
